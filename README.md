# Facilitating Fine-grained Detection of Chinese Toxic Language: Hierarchical Taxonomy, Resources, and Benchmark

***Warning: The samples presented by this paper may be considered offensive or vulgar.***

## Abstract
The widespread dissemination of toxic online posts is increasingly damaging to society. However, research on detecting toxic language in Chinese has lagged significantly. Existing datasets lack fine-grained annotation of toxic types and expressions, and ignore the samples with indirect toxicity. In addition, it is crucial to introduce lexical knowledge to detect the toxicity of posts, which has been a challenge for researchers. In this paper, we facilitate the fine-grained detection of Chinese toxic language.
