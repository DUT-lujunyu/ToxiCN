# Facilitating Fine-grained Detection of Chinese Toxic Language: Hierarchical Taxonomy, Resources, and Benchmark

**The paper has been accepted in ACL 2023 (main conference, long paper).**

‚ò†Ô∏è ***Warning: The samples presented by this paper may be considered offensive or vulgar.***

## üìú Monitor Toxic Frame
we introduce a hierarchical taxonomy **Monitor Toxic Frame**. Based on the taxonomy, the posts are progressively divided into diverse granularities as follows: **_(I) Whether Toxic_**, ***(II) Toxic Type*** (general offensive language or hate speech), ***(III) Targeted Group***, ***(IV) Expression Category*** (explicitness, implicitness, or reporting). 

## üìú ToxiCN
We conduct a fine-grained annotation of posts crawled from _Zhihu_ and _Tieba_, including both direct and indirect toxic samples. And ToxiCN dataset is presented, which has 12k comments containing **_Sexism_**, **_Racism_**, **_Regional Bias_**, **_Anti-LGBTQ_**, and **_Others_**. The dataset is presented in ***ToxiCN_1.0.csv***. Here we simply describe each fine-grain label.

| Label           | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| toxic           | Identify if a comment is toxic (0) or non-toxic (1).         |
| toxic_type      | non-toxic: 0, general offensive language: 1, hate speech: 2  |
| expression      | non-hate: 0, explicit hate speech: 1, implicit hate speech: 2 |
| target (a list) | LGBTQ: Index 0, Region: Index 1, Sexism: Index 2, Racism: Index 3,  others: Index 4, non-hate: Index 5 |

## üìú Insult Lexicon
The resource is still being collated. We will upload it as soon as possible.

## üìú Benchmark
We present a migratable benchmark of **Toxic Knowledge Enhancement** (**TKE**), enriching the text representation. The code is shown in **_modeling_bert.py_**, which is based on **transformers 3.1.0**.

## ‚ùóÔ∏è Ethics Statement
The opinions and findings contained in the samples of our presented dataset should not be interpreted as representing the views expressed or implied by the authors. We hope that the benefits of our proposed resources outweigh their risks. **All resources are for scientific research only.**
